# Policy note: Uses and misuses of Airbnb in Lisbon

## Introduction 

The steady increase in tourist numbers over the past decade has had many positive consequences for Lisbon. The historical center was renovated, the service sector has grown and unemployment is declining. However, there are concerns that tourism may be creating a dual economy and that soaring real estate prices may be pushing out local residents in some neighborhoods. In particular, the so-called sharing economy — promoted by platforms such as Airbnb — is criticized around the world for removing homes from the regular rental market and offering them to tourists as short-term accommodation. As it reduces the range of affordable homes available for permanent residents, the commercial use these platforms cannot be ignored.

Using Airbnb data, this note explores the **spatial and price repartition of listed properties in Lisbon**, focusing on those listed as “entire home/apartment” rather than “shared room” to target cases of commercial use. It reveals the main trends and what could be considered as potential **misuses and abuses** from a social justice perspective. Based on the results of this research, it proposes **policy solutions** to ensure a fairer redistribution of benefits generated through Airbnb among Lisbon’s population. 

## Findings

### A concentration in the city center

The mapping of Airbnb listings in Lisbon reveals that they concentrate heavily in the city center and in touristic areas. In particular, the traditional neighborhood of Alfama exhibits the greatest density of listings (it encompasses Misericórdia and Santa Maria Maior, the two neighborhoods with the largest number of listings). A study by [Cocola-Gant and Gago (2019)](https://agustincocolagant.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cocola-Gant-Gago-EPA.pdf) actually reveals that in December 2016, **25% of the entire housing stock** in Alfama consisted of short-term rentals on Airbnb, while it formed only 16% of the housing stock a year earlier.

### The professionalization of the short-term rental market

Even though Airbnb claims to be a platform favoring occasional home-sharing, this study reveals the commercial use of Airbnb by professionals. First of all, of the 18,197 listings in Lisbon itself, **74%** are entire homes/apartments, rather than shared rooms as Airbnb claims.
Moreover, the study of the availability of Airbnb listings in Lisbon shows that there is a growing number of listings available for longer periods of time. In fact, there is a large part of the listings that is available for more than 300 days up to 365 days per year. This suggests that a majority of Airbnb apartments in Lisbon are solely dedicated to Airbnb, and not apartments rented for short periods of time when not used by the owner or primary renter. Thus, this points to the commercial use of a part of the housing market in Lisbon, especially in the city center and touristic areas.

The professionalization of the short-term rental market on Airbnb is even more striking when looking at the top 10 “hosts” in Lisbon. Indeed, they have more than 60 listings each, and totalize 1,129 entire home listings in Lisbon. The number of flats they each have (up to 266) and even the names of these “hosts” clearly reveals that they are professional companies, that either own a large portfolio of flats in Lisbon, or act as commercial intermediaries to manage properties for third parties. 

_Top 10 hosts with the highest number of listings (entire homes, in Lisboa):_

|Host name|Number of Listings|
|:-----:|:-----:|
|Albertino|63|
|BnBird Homes|63|
|Lisbon Five Stars Apartments|67|
|TravelingToLisbon|67|
|Sweet Inn|75|
|LxWay|109|
|Homing|170|
|Rent Experience|191|
|Feels like Home|266|

The mapping of the flats rented by the four biggest hosts reveals the tremendous number of flats they manage. Moreover, the great majority of the flats the four biggest hosts have are concentrated in the city center. It shows very strikingly the professionalization of Airbnb in Lisbon, and the tacit change in land use from residential to tourist uses, that pushes local residents out of some areas like the city center.

### Airbnb prices relate to scarcity more than real estate prices

There does not seem to be a direct link between the price of real estate in a neighborhood and the average price of Airbnb listings in this neighborhood — listings in “expensive” neighborhoods are not necessarily more expensive, because size and amenities are also taken into account. Still, there is a difference of 50€ per night on average between affordable areas like Beato and Santo António or Misericórdia, the city’s wealthiest areas. We can note that the average price per night is the highest in neighborhoods with very few listings (Carnide, São Domingos de Benfica and Benfica in the west and Marvila in the east). Assuming that Airbnb prices are related to scarcity is not far-fetched — low prices can help landlords showcase their property in a crowded market. Nevertheless, as the data did not allow for temporal comparisons, we cannot say that Airbnb does not contribute to raising real estate prices all over the city on the long run.

## Policy recommendations

Even though we could not confirm whether Airbnb increases real estate prices, the data give evidence of the professionalization of Airbnb, which can pose many threats to the city — from the eviction of long-term tenants to the transformation of neighborhoods into theme parks for tourists, not to mention non-compliance with tax requirements. A few policy recommendations to limit the misuse of platforms such as Airbnb include:
- issuing a statute to regulate short-term rentals, specifying that platform users must be people, not companies, and that the owner or the primary renter must occupy the home for a certain number of days; 
- levying local taxes on short-term rentals to subsidize housing for the poorest permanent residents in each neighborhood; 
- creating a municipal task force to check compliance with rules and fine violators;
- reaching an agreement with platforms (like the one between Barcelona and Airbnb) so that local officials can access their data in real time, in order to facilitate investigation.
